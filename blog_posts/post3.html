            <h1 class="title">My upcoming Project: E-Commerce Website For Online Shopping</h1>

            
            	<p>
            		The main purpose of this blog is to anounce my upcoming project. Soon I will start working on my next project which will be a full stack application. 
            	</p>

    	        <h3 class='text-green'>Project Idea</h3>
    	        <p>
    	           For this full stack application project, I will be creating an E-Commerce Website which allows users to shop online.  
    	        </p>

                <h3 class='text-green'>Abstract</h3>
    	        <p>
    	            This E-Commerce Website will be an online shopping site for different categories of products. The target audience for this application are those who prefers to shop online rather than in physical stores.  
    	        </p>

    	        <p>
    	        	This application allows a user to create an account, login into their account, search for products, add items to cart, remove items from cart, pay and logout. For frontend, I will use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. For backend, I will use Node as the runtime environment and Express as the web framework. And for database I will be using MongoDB.
    	        </p>


    	        <h3 class='text-green'>Reason To Select This Topic</h3>
    	        <p>
    	           I have selected this application because an E-Commerce Website is a neccesity for almost all the companies which sell any kinds of products. The skill to create such a website and a full stack application will be a plus point and it will look good on a resume. Thus it will increase the chances of getting hired in such product selling companies.
