Currently I’m working on a project to build my own online portfolio and in the process, I had to learn some very important tools like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. I would like to share with you what I have learned so far. In this blog, my focus will be purely on HTML.

                <h3 class='text-blue'>What is HTML?</h3>
    	        <p>
    	            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is a formatting language used to define the appearance and contents of a web page. It allows us to organize text, graphics, audio, and video on a web page. It is not a programming language, but rather a language that identifies the meaning, purpose, and structure of text within a document. HTML has come a long way since Tim Berners-Lee invented it in 1991. HTML5 is the latest version supported by modern web browsers.

                        <td>The word markup refers to the symbols that are used to define structure of the text. The markup symbols tell the browser how to display the text and are often called tags.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Language</td>
                        <td>The word Language refers to the syntax that is similar to any other language.</td>
                    </tr>

    	        <h3 class='text-blue'>Basic Requirements</h3>
    	        <p>
    	            In order to write HTML code, only a notepad and a browser is enough. But to have better visual and colorful experience, you may use a text editor like Sublime Text, Notepad++ or any other text editor of your choice. For web browser, Google chrome is preferred as it offers a lot of tools.

    	        <h3 class='text-blue'>HTML Tags</h3>
    	        <p>
    	            Tag, also called elements, is a command that tells the web browser how to display the text, audio, graphics or video on a web page. Tags are indicated with pair of angle brackets. They start with a less than (<) character and end with a greater than (>) character. The tag name is specified between the angle brackets. Most of the tags usually occur in pair,i.e. the start tag and the closing tag. The start tag is simply the tag name enclosed in angle bracket whereas the closing tag is specified including a forward slash (/). Some tags are empty i.e. they don’t have the closing tag like the null tags. Tags are case insensitive. The starting and closing tag name must be the same. If you don’t specify the angle brackets for a tag, the browser will treat the tag name as a simple text.

                <h3 class='text-blue'>HTML syntax</h3>
                <p>
                    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration. Then it begins and ends with html tags. The part which are visible on web pages is between the body tags of a HTML document. You can write heading using heading tags written as 'h' in angle brackets and paragraphs written a 'p' in angle brackets. The gif below shows the syntax of a basic HTML document.

    	        <h3 class='text-blue'>Conclusion</h3>
    	        <p>
    	           When you open a html file in browser, you will see the page looks like the image below. That's it!! Now you know HTML and where to start with. Just by using the HTML tags you can create your web pages and then style it using CSS.
